## WEEK 14 - Communicating Results to Business Stakeholders

We talked on Week 12 about Data Visualization. Now it's time to understand that Data Visualization is not an end in itself, but a tool - a very important one - to communicate messages. The crucial takeaway for this week: __effective communication is about good storytelling and effective delivery__.

Data Scientists are throughly trained on techniques to extract value from data, but not always in how to communicate that value to audiences that do not share that technical training. Scott Berinato's (2019) article - [__Data Science & The Art of Persuasion__](https://hbr.org/2019/01/data-science-and-the-art-of-persuasion) - discusses the __importance of persuasion as a necessary skill for effective Data Scientists__.  His argument: Data Science has not fully delivered its potential impact because __Data Scientists are not always skilled at communicating insights to business stakeholders__.


### Data storytelling

It should be clear by now that Data Scientists should also be data storytellers. But what exactly is this skill - data storytelling - that's in short supply among Data Scientists? Brent Dykes' (2016) article - [__Data Storytelling: The Essential Data Science Skill Everyone Needs__](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brentdykes/2016/03/31/data-storytelling-the-essential-data-science-skill-everyone-needs/#5127ea6352ad) - explains __why and how data storytelling is essential for Data Science__. Briefly, data storytelling should be able to __explain, enlighten__ and __engage__ audiences. In his words:

> Data storytelling is a structured approach for communicating data insights, and it involves a combination of three key elements: _data_, _visuals_, and _narrative_. [...] When you combine the right visuals and narrative with the right data, you have a data story that can influence and drive __change__.

If you're curious to see data storytelling in action with examples that New Yorkers would be proud of, watch Ben Wellington's (2015) TEDx talk - [__Making data mean more through storytelling__](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xsvGYIxJok). Asides from giving good examples of data storytelling, he also shares his 4 key lessons for good data storytelling.  

### The power of storytelling

What are we really talking about that is different from just good data visualizations? Let's start by __defining "story" in data storytelling__. Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic's (2017) podcast - [__What is story?__](http://storytellingwithdata.libsyn.com/storytelling-with-data-2-what-is-story) - discusses what "story" is, how it relates to how we communicate with data, and how to build the narrative you want to communicate.

A good story is powerful because is engages our human nature. David JP Phillips' (2017) TEDx talk - [__The magical science of storytelling__](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nj-hdQMa3uA) - very vividly explains the neuroscience and endocrinology of storytelling to help us understand why it's such a powerful tool.


### Effective delivery

Crafting a great "story" is remarkable, but not enough. Data Scientists also need a vehicle - a deck (presentation) -  to convey their story, and must develop the ability to understand the context where they will communicate to maximize effectiveness in delivery.

__How do you create a "good" deck?__ Jan Zawadzki's (2018) blog post - [__Storytelling for Data Scientists__](https://towardsdatascience.com/storytelling-for-data-scientists-317c2723aa31) - does a great job boiling down deck-building to its core elements with very concrete examples. Seems like a short piece, but there is a lot of good information there. Read it twice.

__What does effective delivery look like?__ Read Almond Lee's (2018) blog post - [__Storytelling with Data: A Data Visualization Guide for Business Professionals__](https://towardsdatascience.com/storytelling-with-data-a-data-visualization-guide-for-business-professionals-97d50512b407) - and take note of his 6-item checklist that compound actions to ensure that you communicate your message and deliver it effectively.

### What data storytelling is not...

There's always a cautionary tale to be told. Read Keith McNulty's (2018) blog post - [__Beware of "storytelling" in data and analytics__](https://towardsdatascience.com/beware-of-storytelling-with-data-1710fea554b0) - where he details the three key fails in data storytelling. In a nutshell,  data storytelling fails when it is not means to deliver findings, but becomes the vehicle to confirm a pre-cooked narrative that may have little to do with the data at hand. Fortunately, he also summarizes a good antidote: his __five elements to maintain the integrity of a research-based approach__, which Data Science should not deviate from.
