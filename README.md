This repository is a companion to the course __Applied Data Science for Social Scientists__ taught at the [__Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences__](http://qmss.columbia.edu/) program over the Spring of 2023.

It contains curated reference materials, slides and sample code. You can find the most updated version of the course syllabus [here](/syllabus/GR5069_Spring2023.pdf). Make sure to check regularly for updates.


## Overview

In his now classic [Venn diagram](http://drewconway.com/zia/2013/3/26/the-data-science-venn-diagram), [Drew Conway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drew_Conway) described **Data Science** as sitting at the intersection between **good hacking skills**, **math / statistics knowledge**, and **substantive expertise**. Standard quantitative training in the social sciences supplies a fluid combination of all three, but tailored to **understanding human behavior**, and to **explaining why things happen the way they do**. Social scientists are, thus, a particular kind of data scientist.

This course is a collection of topics that fill very specific gaps identified over the years on what a social scientist should know at minimum when entering Data Science, and the skills and best practices a data scientist should know  to add immediate value to their teams.

To do that, this course aims to:
* teach processes and practices at the **intersection of Data Science and Data Engineering** that are central to the **data product cycle**. Data Scientists typically start being exposed to Data Engineering on the job. There's much to be gained from early exposure to concepts and practices in this field;

* sharpen technical skills not only in **fitting models**, but particularly in **building knowledge and generating insights** from the data. While this may seem obvious for a Data Scientist, it is not always the focus of training,

* train in **working effectively in teams** to build projects and products. Data Science is collaborative in nature and constantly evolving in **best practices** that enhance efficient collaboration. Collaboration for school projects/assignments is vastly different from the **highly-structured collaboration** that happens in DS teams, but is not always the focus of training, and

All of these are highly valued skills in the Data Science job market, but not always considered explicitly as part of an integral Data Science curriculum.

## Prerequisites:

It is assumed that students have basic to intermediate knowledge of object-oriented programming - e.g [**R**](https://www.r-project.org/) or [__Python__](https://www.python.org) - including experience using it for data manipulation, visualizations, and model estimation. Some mathematics, statistics and algebra are also assumed.

## Course Resources

There are no required textbooks for this course. The course will rely on a combination of curated reading materials, in-class workshops and take-home exercises that will leverage the following tools:
* __Slack__
* __GitHub / GitHub classroom__
* __AWS__
* __Databricks__

## To actively participate on this course

Make sure to have the latest versions of [__R__](https://www.r-project.org/)/[__RStudio__](https://www.rstudio.com/), and/or [__Anaconda__](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/), as well as [__git__](https://git-scm.com/) installed on your computer. Sign up for a [__GitHub__](https://github.com) account if you don't have one already.

Registered students will receive instructions to access __GitHub classroom__, __Slack__, __AWS__, and __Databricks__.
